# Machine_Learning_Algorithms
In this repository you will get all necessary algorithms, for supervised and unsupervised learning (Clustering). It's simple and will be a good code guide for Kick-start in ML.

LogisticRegression, KNNm and Naive Bayesian algorithms were forked to use another dataset that is to be read from a csv file, if not previously. In addition, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1, and RoC analysis was added to each algorithm to provide the needed statistics which can help in comparisons.
